## 🎯 Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets** (API keys, passwords, tokens)
2. **Use secure coding practices** (input validation, output encoding)
3. **Keep dependencies updated** (regularly update to latest secure versions)
4. **Follow authentication best practices** (strong passwords, 2FA)
5. **Validate all inputs** (sanitize and validate user inputs)
6. **Use HTTPS everywhere** (secure communication channels)

### For Users

1. **Keep software updated** (use latest versions with security patches)
2. **Use strong authentication** (complex passwords, multi-factor authentication)
3. **Monitor for suspicious activity** (review logs and access patterns)
4. **Follow principle of least privilege** (minimal necessary permissions)
5. **Regular security audits** (periodic security assessments)
