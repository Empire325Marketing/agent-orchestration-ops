## ⚠️ Manual Steps Required (GitHub App Permissions)

### 🔐 GitHub App Permissions Issue
The GitHub App currently lacks the `workflows` permission required to create/modify workflow files. This is a security restriction by GitHub.

**Required Action**: Visit [GitHub App Configurations](https://github.com/apps/abacusai/installations/select_target) and grant the following permissions:
- ✅ **Workflows** (Read & Write) - Required for CI/CD automation
- ✅ **Secrets** (Read & Write) - Required for environment configuration  
- ✅ **Variables** (Read & Write) - Required for configuration management
- ✅ **Environments** (Read & Write) - Required for deployment gates

### 📁 Workflow Files Ready for Manual Upload
