- Consequences: Expected outcomes and trade-offs
- Status: PROPOSED | ACCEPTED | DEPRECATED | SUPERSEDED
- Stakeholders: Who was involved in the decision

---

[2025-09-29] ARCH-001: Operational Framework Structure
- Context: Need for standardized operational procedures and monitoring for agent orchestration systems
- Decision: Implement comprehensive ops framework with runbooks, alerts, gates, and analytics
- Rationale: Ensures reliability, observability, and maintainability of agent systems in production
- Consequences: Increased operational overhead but significantly improved system reliability and incident response
- Status: ACCEPTED
- Stakeholders: Platform Team, Operations Team, Development Team

[2025-09-29] PROC-001: Branch Protection and Review Requirements
- Context: Need for code quality gates and change management in operational repository
- Decision: Implement branch protection with required PR reviews and status checks
- Rationale: Prevents direct pushes to main branches and ensures all changes are reviewed
- Consequences: Slower deployment of urgent fixes but improved change quality and audit trail
- Status: ACCEPTED
- Stakeholders: DevOps Team, Security Team, Platform Team

[2025-09-29] AUTO-001: CI/CD Pipeline for Operational Validation
- Context: Need for automated validation of operational artifacts and configurations
- Decision: Implement GitHub Actions workflow with readiness:agents, alerts:validate, and runbooks:index checks
- Rationale: Ensures operational artifacts are valid and complete before deployment
- Consequences: Automated quality gates reduce manual review burden and catch issues early
- Status: ACCEPTED
- Stakeholders: DevOps Team, Operations Team

[2025-09-29] GOV-001: Code Ownership and Review Assignment
- Context: Need for clear ownership and review responsibilities for different operational components
- Decision: Implement CODEOWNERS file with path-based review assignments
- Rationale: Ensures appropriate subject matter experts review changes to their domains
- Consequences: More targeted reviews but potential bottlenecks if owners are unavailable
- Status: ACCEPTED
- Stakeholders: All Teams, Engineering Management

[2025-09-29] DRILL-001: Tabletop Exercise Simulation Framework
- Context: Need for regular disaster recovery and incident response training
- Decision: Implement quarterly tabletop drill simulations with documented scenarios and outcomes
- Rationale: Improves team preparedness and identifies gaps in operational procedures
- Consequences: Time investment in drill preparation and execution but improved incident response capabilities
- Status: ACCEPTED
- Stakeholders: Operations Team, Security Team, Platform Team

## Tabletop Drill Simulation Entry

[2025-09-29] DRILL-SIM-001: Q4 2025 Agent Orchestration Failure Simulation
- Scenario: Complete failure of primary agent orchestration cluster during peak traffic
- Participants: Operations Team, Platform Team, Security Team, Engineering Management
- Duration: 2 hours
- Objectives:
  1. Test failover procedures to secondary cluster
  2. Validate alert escalation and notification systems
  3. Assess communication protocols during major incidents
  4. Evaluate rollback and recovery procedures
- Simulated Conditions:
  - Primary cluster becomes unresponsive at 14:00 UTC
  - Secondary cluster has 60% capacity of primary
  - Customer-facing services experiencing 30% traffic spike
  - Two key team members unavailable (vacation simulation)
- Expected Outcomes:
  1. Failover completed within 15 minutes
  2. All stakeholders notified within 5 minutes
  3. Customer impact minimized to <5 minutes downtime
  4. Post-incident review completed within 24 hours
- Success Criteria:
  - RTO (Recovery Time Objective): <15 minutes
  - RPO (Recovery Point Objective): <1 minute data loss
  - Communication: All stakeholders informed within SLA
  - Documentation: Complete incident timeline and lessons learned
- Preparation Requirements:
  1. Review all runbooks in /runbooks directory
  2. Validate alert configurations in /alerts directory
  3. Test communication channels and escalation procedures
  4. Prepare isolated test environment for simulation
- Post-Drill Actions:
  1. Update runbooks based on identified gaps
  2. Refine alert thresholds and notification rules
  3. Schedule follow-up training for identified weaknesses
  4. Document lessons learned in DECISIONS.log
- Status: SCHEDULED
- Next Review: 2025-12-15
- Stakeholders: Operations Team Lead, Platform Engineering Manager, Security Team Lead
