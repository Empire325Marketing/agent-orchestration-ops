## Decision Guidelines

When making architectural decisions:

1. **Document the Context**: Clearly explain the situation that requires a decision
2. **Consider Alternatives**: Evaluate multiple options before deciding
3. **Assess Impact**: Consider both positive and negative consequences
4. **Seek Input**: Involve relevant stakeholders in the decision process
5. **Update Status**: Keep decision records current as situations evolve
6. **Learn and Adapt**: Use outcomes to inform future decisions

## Review Process

- Architectural decisions should be reviewed quarterly
- Deprecated decisions should be clearly marked
- Superseded decisions should reference their replacements
- New decisions should consider existing decisions for consistency
