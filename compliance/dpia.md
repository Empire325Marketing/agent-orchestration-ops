# Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) - MVP

## Processing Description
The system processes personal data for HR AI applications including automated resume screening, performance analysis, and employee development recommendations. Processing involves collection, storage, analysis, and automated decision-making on employee and candidate data within defined organizational boundaries.

## Necessity and Proportionality
Processing is necessary for employment management and talent acquisition based on legitimate interests and contractual obligations. Data minimization principles ensure only relevant data is processed. Retention periods align with legal requirements and business necessity as defined in jurisdiction_matrix.yaml.

## Risks Identified

### Bias and Discrimination Risk
- **Risk**: AI models may exhibit bias in recruitment or performance evaluation
- **Impact**: High - potential for discriminatory outcomes affecting individuals
- **Likelihood**: Medium - inherent risk in ML systems without proper controls

### Data Breach Risk
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access to sensitive HR data
- **Impact**: High - exposure of personal and professional information
- **Likelihood**: Low - with implemented security controls

### Automated Decision-Making Risk
- **Risk**: Lack of human oversight in AI-driven decisions
- **Impact**: Medium - individuals affected by opaque algorithmic decisions
- **Likelihood**: Low - human oversight controls in place

## Mitigations Implemented

### Data Minimization
- Only necessary data fields collected per record type
- Regular review and purging per retention schedules
- Purpose limitation enforced through access controls

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Least-privilege access to personal data
- Service identities defined in service_identities.md
- Vault-managed credentials with rotation schedules

### Audit and Transparency
- Comprehensive logging per observability framework
- Trace coverage SLO ensures decision auditability
- Regular compliance audits per runbooks/compliance-audit.md

### Human Oversight
- Mandatory human review for high-risk AI decisions
- Clear escalation procedures for edge cases
- Regular bias testing and model evaluation

## Residual Risk Assessment
After implementing mitigations, residual risks are assessed as:
- Bias/Discrimination: Low (with human oversight and bias testing)
- Data Breach: Very Low (with security controls and encryption)
- Automated Decision-Making: Low (with human-in-the-loop controls)
