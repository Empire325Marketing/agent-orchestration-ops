## Performance Impact Analysis

### Database Performance
- **Connection Time**: < 50ms (within normal range)
- **Query Response Time**: Avg 23ms (baseline: 21ms)
- **Throughput**: 847 QPS achieved (baseline: 865 QPS)
- **Performance Degradation**: < 3% ✅

### Application Layer Impact
- **API Latency**: P95 remained at 127ms during cutover
- **Error Rate**: 0.02% (well within 0.1% threshold)
- **Connection Pool**: Healthy, no connection leaks
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 94.2% (minimal impact)

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Automated WAL-G Integration**: Seamless backup identification and restore
2. **Validation Scripts**: Comprehensive integrity checking caught no issues
3. **Monitoring Coverage**: Real-time visibility throughout exercise
4. **Documentation**: Step-by-step runbook followed successfully

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Parallel Processing**: WAL replay could be optimized for faster recovery
2. **Pre-warming**: Cache warming post-restore could reduce performance gap
3. **Automation**: Manual steps in cutover could be scripted
4. **Alert Tuning**: Some false alerts during planned cutover

### Action Items
- [ ] Implement parallel WAL replay (ETA: Oct 15, 2025)
- [ ] Add cache pre-warming to restore procedure (ETA: Oct 10, 2025)
- [ ] Automate DNS/config cutover scripts (ETA: Oct 20, 2025)
- [ ] Tune monitoring alerts for planned exercises (ETA: Oct 5, 2025)

## Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks
1. **Network Partition**: During cutover, brief connectivity impact
2. **WAL Corruption**: Single point of failure in WAL archiving
3. **Cache Cold Start**: Performance impact post-restore

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Multi-AZ WAL Storage**: Implemented cross-region backup replication
2. **Health Check Improvements**: Enhanced readiness probes
3. **Gradual Cutover**: Blue-green deployment patterns for future exercises

## Compliance & Audit

### SLA Compliance
- **Availability Target**: 99.95% monthly (maintained)
- **RTO SLA**: Met with 10% margin
- **RPO SLA**: Met with 20% margin
- **Data Integrity**: 100% validation success

### Regulatory Evidence
- **SOC 2 Type II**: DR exercise documented for compliance
- **GDPR**: Data residency maintained during restore
- **HIPAA**: Audit trail continuity verified

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 7 Days)
