Rollback Actions Completed:
  - Canary deployments scaled to 0
  - Traffic routed to stable version (100%)
  - Stable deployments verified healthy
  
Rollback Status: COMPLETED
Completion Time: $(date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC")

Post-Rollback Verification:
  - Stable version serving all traffic
  - No canary pods running
  - System health: OK

Next Steps:
  1. Investigate root cause: ${ROLLBACK_REASON}
  2. Fix issues in canary version
  3. Re-test in lower environment
  4. Plan next deployment attempt

ROLLBACK SUMMARY
================================================================================
Rollback ID: ${ROLLBACK_ID}
Environment: ${ENVIRONMENT}
Timestamp: ${TIMESTAMP}
Reason: ${ROLLBACK_REASON}

Actions Taken:
  ✓ Canary deployments scaled to 0 replicas
  ✓ Traffic routed to stable version (100%)
  ✓ Stable deployments verified healthy
  ✓ Rollback logged to DECISIONS.log

Current State:
  - Stable version: ACTIVE (100% traffic)
  - Canary version: TERMINATED
  - System health: STABLE

Investigation Required:
  ${ROLLBACK_REASON}

Recommendations:
  1. Analyze logs from canary deployment
  2. Review metrics during canary period
  3. Identify and fix root cause
  4. Test fix in dev/staging environment
  5. Plan next deployment with additional safeguards
