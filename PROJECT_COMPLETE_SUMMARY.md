### Cost Management (Chapter 12)
- Per-tenant budget controls ($10/day default)
- Progressive throttling at 50%, 75%, 90% thresholds
- Model downgrade ladder for cost optimization
- Kill-switch for emergency cost control

### Readiness Gates (Chapter 13)
- Shadow → Canary → Production promotion path
- Multi-dimensional validation:
  - Performance: p95 ≤ 950ms (API), ≤ 1500ms (LLM)
  - Quality: Golden win rate ≥ 0.90
  - Safety: Zero PII leaks, zero jailbreaks
  - Cost: Budget compliance with 20% headroom
  - Compliance: All retention hooks operational

### Risk Management (Chapter 14)
- Living risk register with 12 seeded risks
- Weekly/monthly/quarterly review cadence
- Risk-to-runbook mapping for all identified risks
- Temporary exception procedures with time-boxing

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Local-First Strategy**: On-premises LLM deployment for data sovereignty
2. **PostgreSQL + pgvector**: Primary vector storage with Qdrant as scale-out option
3. **Kong API Gateway**: Battle-tested gateway for traffic management
4. **Vault for Secrets**: Enterprise-grade secret management
5. **OpenTelemetry**: Vendor-neutral observability
6. **Canary Deployments**: Risk-reduced rollout strategy
7. **GPU Pool Architecture**: Weighted routing with failover (70/20/10 split)
