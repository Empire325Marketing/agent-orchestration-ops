# Chapter 9 â€” Compliance

## Scope & High-Risk Definition
The compliance framework focuses on HR AI features as high-risk applications under the EU AI Act. This includes automated resume screening, performance evaluation assistance, and employee data processing. High-risk designation triggers enhanced obligations for risk management, data governance, human oversight, and post-market monitoring.

## Success Criteria
Success is measured by the presence of complete jurisdiction matrices covering all applicable record types, filled DPIA and AI Act templates with documented risk assessments, defined thresholds and incident triggers for compliance breaches, and operational runbooks linking to existing deletion, legal-hold, and DSR procedures.
