# Patch Window Execution Runbook

## Pre-patch preparation (T-48h)
1. **Review vulnerability queue**: Confirm patches ready for deployment
2. **Test in staging**: Verify patches in staging environment 
3. **Prepare rollback**: Ensure quick rollback capability
4. **Notify stakeholders**: Send patch window notification
5. **Schedule resources**: Ensure on-call coverage during window

## Patch window execution (T-0)
### Phase 1: Pre-checks (15 min)
- Verify system health baselines
- Confirm backup completion
- Check readiness gates (Ch.13)
- Enable enhanced monitoring

### Phase 2: Patching (2-3 hours)
- Deploy patches in order of criticality
- Monitor system metrics continuously
- Test critical path functionality
- Document any issues or deviations

### Phase 3: Validation (30 min)
- Run post-patch health checks
- Verify vulnerability scan shows remediation
- Confirm performance within SLO targets
- Update vulnerability register status

### Phase 4: Cleanup (15 min)
- Return monitoring to normal levels
- Document patch window results
- Update PROJECT_STATUS if needed
- Send completion notification

## Emergency procedures
- **Rollback trigger**: Any critical system failure or performance degradation >20%
- **Abort conditions**: Multiple service failures, data corruption detected
- **Escalation**: Page incident commander if rollback doesn't resolve issues

## Success criteria
- All planned vulnerabilities remediated
- System performance within normal range
- No security functionality degraded
- Audit trail complete (Ch.31)
