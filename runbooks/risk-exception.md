# Runbook â€” Risk Exception Management

## Temporary Policy Exception Process

### When to Request an Exception
- Security policy temporarily prevents critical business function
- Compliance requirement creates operational emergency
- Risk mitigation causes service unavailability
- Emergency response requires policy deviation
- Time-sensitive business opportunity blocked by policy

### Exception Request Process

#### Step 1: Exception Request Submission
1. **Requestor** submits formal exception request
2. **Business justification** documented with impact analysis
3. **Risk assessment** performed with alternative controls
4. **Time limitation** specified with clear end date
5. **Monitoring plan** defined for exception period

#### Step 2: Exception Review and Approval
1. **Risk owner** reviews technical feasibility and risk
2. **Security team** assesses security implications
3. **Compliance officer** evaluates regulatory impact
4. **Business owner** approves business case
5. **Dual approval** required for critical systems

#### Step 3: Exception Implementation
1. **Technical implementation** with monitoring controls
2. **Documentation** of exception in DECISIONS.log
3. **Alert configuration** for exception monitoring
4. **Communication** to affected teams and stakeholders
5. **Review schedule** established for exception period

#### Step 4: Exception Monitoring
1. **Continuous monitoring** of risk indicators during exception
2. **Regular status updates** to approval authorities
3. **Escalation procedures** if risks materialize
4. **Early termination** if conditions change
5. **Impact tracking** for post-exception analysis

#### Step 5: Exception Revocation
1. **Planned termination** at scheduled end date
2. **Early revocation** if risks exceed tolerance
3. **Emergency revocation** if security breach occurs
4. **Restoration** of original policies and controls
5. **Post-exception review** and lessons learned

### Exception Categories

- **Cumulative limit**: 180 days per year per policy

### Monitoring and Alerting

#### Required Monitoring
- **Security monitoring**: Increased alerting during security exceptions
- **Compliance tracking**: Documentation of compliance impact

    - failed_authentication_attempts
    - unauthorized_access_patterns
    - data_exfiltration_indicators
    - privilege_escalation_attempts

  compliance_exception:
    - data_retention_violations
    - privacy_control_bypasses
