# Runbook â€” Failover and Disaster Recovery

## Region Failover Checklist

### Pre-Failover Assessment
1) Verify primary region is truly unavailable
2) Confirm secondary region readiness and capacity
3) Check data replication lag and consistency
4) Validate network connectivity to secondary region
5) Ensure compliance requirements met for target region

### Failover Execution
1) Activate incident response per incident.md procedures
2) Update DNS to point to secondary region endpoints
3) Start services in secondary region with validated configuration
4) Verify database failover and connection health
5) Test critical user journeys and API endpoints
6) Update monitoring and alerting for new region

### Post-Failover Validation
1) Confirm all services operational in secondary region
2) Validate data integrity and recent transaction recovery
3) Test backup and restore procedures in new region
4) Update status page with current operational status
5) Begin investigation of primary region failure

## RTO/RPO Targets (Placeholders)
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 4 hours maximum
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 1 hour maximum data loss
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: 2 hours target
- **Business continuity threshold**: 99.9% annual uptime

## Restore Verification Steps

### Data Validation
1) Compare record counts between regions
2) Verify recent transactions are present
3) Check data consistency across related tables
4) Validate backup integrity and restore capability

### Service Validation
1) Execute health checks on all critical services
2) Test authentication and authorization flows
3) Verify external integrations and API connectivity
4) Confirm monitoring and logging operational

### User Acceptance
1) Test representative user workflows
2) Verify performance meets SLA requirements
3) Check feature availability matches expectations
4) Validate security controls remain effective

## Rollback Procedures
1) Assess primary region recovery status
2) Ensure data sync between regions before rollback
3) Plan maintenance window for DNS and traffic cutover
4) Execute reverse failover following same checklist
5) Monitor for split-brain scenarios during transition
6) Document lessons learned and update procedures
