# Runbook â€” Cost Guardrails

## Tenant Budget Monitoring

### Budget Categories
- **LLM inference costs**: Token usage and model compute time
- **Vector operations**: Similarity search and embedding generation
- **External API calls**: Third-party service consumption
- **Storage costs**: Database and file storage usage
- **Bandwidth costs**: Egress and data transfer

### Monitoring Thresholds
- **50% budget**: Warning alert to tenant and account manager
- **75% budget**: Throttling non-essential features
- **90% budget**: Aggressive throttling and usage restrictions
- **100% budget**: Service suspension pending payment or upgrade

## Throttling Mechanisms

### Progressive Throttling (75% threshold)
1) Reduce LLM context window to minimum viable
2) Limit vector search results and complexity
3) Increase cache TTL to reduce API calls
4) Batch non-urgent operations
5) Disable optional features and analytics

### Aggressive Throttling (90% threshold)
1) Queue all non-critical requests
2) Reduce API rate limits by 50%
3) Limit concurrent sessions per user
4) Disable file uploads and processing
5) Read-only mode for administrative functions

## Downgrade Path (Budget Exceeded)

### Immediate Actions
1) Suspend new resource-intensive operations
2) Preserve existing user sessions where possible
3) Display budget exceeded notification to users
4) Provide self-service upgrade options
5) Alert account management team

### Service Restrictions
- Core authentication and read operations continue
- New content creation disabled
- AI-powered features suspended
- Export functionality remains available
- Administrative access for billing updates maintained

### Communication Protocol
1) Automated email notification at each threshold
2) In-app banner notifications for active users
3) Account manager outreach for enterprise customers
4) Grace period (24-48 hours) before suspension
5) Clear upgrade path and cost estimates provided

## Cost Optimization Recommendations

### Automated Suggestions
- Model selection optimization for use case
- Caching strategy improvements
- Batch processing for similar requests
- Feature usage analysis and recommendations

### Manual Review Triggers
- Unusual spending patterns detected
- Rapid budget consumption rate
- High-cost operation frequency spikes
- Cross-tenant cost comparison anomalies

## Recovery Procedures
1) Process payment or upgrade authorization
2) Gradually restore throttled features
3) Monitor for spending pattern changes
4) Update budget thresholds if needed
5) Document incident and optimization opportunities
