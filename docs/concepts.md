# Key Concepts

- **Gateway vs Orchestrator**: routing, auth, retries.
- **Memory**: OLTP rows (pgvector optional) + retention.
- **Safety**: guardrails, red-team sets, zero-tolerance gates.
- **Readiness**: shadow → canary → rollout thresholds.
- **Cost guards**: budgets, throttles, downgrade ladder.
