# Primarch Enterprise AI Platform - Complete Overview

## Project Status: ✅ COMPLETE
**51 directories, 317 files, 38 chapters implemented**

## Architecture Summary

### Core Platform (Chapters 0-9)
- **API Gateway**: Kong OSS with rate limiting, routing, authentication
- **Model Runtime**: vLLM serving Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with AWQ quantization
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings, optional Qdrant scaling
- **Tool Registry**: 10 curated tools with PII risk classification
- **Sandbox/Proxy**: Network-off by default, allowlist-based egress control
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry with tail sampling, SLO monitoring
- **Secrets**: HashiCorp Vault with automated rotation
- **Compliance**: GDPR/AI Act alignment with retention policies

### Security & Governance (Chapters 17-34)
- **Authentication**: Multi-layered OAuth, JWT, API keys with mTLS
- **Authorization**: RBAC with tenant isolation, permission matrix
- **Safety Systems**: Prompt firewall, toxicity detection, content filtering
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable logging with cryptographic chains
- **Data Residency**: Regional compliance (EU, CA, US)
- **SIEM Integration**: Splunk/Elastic mappings with detection rules
- **Vulnerability Management**: Automated scanning, patching policies

### Operations & Reliability (Chapters 10-16, 35-37)
- **CI/CD**: Progressive rollout (shadow → canary → production)
- **Incident Response**: 47 runbooks covering all failure scenarios
- **Disaster Recovery**: RTO 4h, RPO 1h with validated backup procedures
- **Capacity Planning**: Auto-scaling with cost guardrails
- **Chaos Engineering**: Controlled failure injection for resilience testing
- **Model Lifecycle**: Evaluation, promotion, rollback procedures
- **Readiness Gates**: 16+ gate configurations for safe deployments

### Business & User Experience (Chapters 18-32)
- **Multi-tenancy**: Row-level security, tenant isolation
- **Billing & Usage**: Real-time metering, rate structures, dispute handling
- **SDK Development**: Python, JavaScript, CLI with versioning
- **Admin Portal**: KPI dashboards, system controls, user management
- **Tenant Portal**: Self-service exports, usage analytics, DSR handling
- **Support Systems**: Tiered SLA/OLA structure, escalation procedures
- **Knowledge Management**: Structured documentation, in-product guidance

## Production Readiness

### ✅ Complete Components
- All architectural decisions documented and locked
- Security baselines established with detection rules
- Operational procedures for all failure scenarios
- Compliance frameworks aligned with regulations
- Multi-tenant isolation and billing systems
- Progressive deployment with automated gates

### Next Steps for Implementation
1. **Infrastructure Setup**: Deploy base services (Postgres, Vault, Kong)
2. **Model Deployment**: Configure vLLM runtime with selected model
3. **Security Hardening**: Enable mTLS, configure firewalls
4. **Observability Stack**: Deploy OpenTelemetry, configure dashboards
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement progressive rollout automation
6. **Testing**: Execute chaos experiments, validate gates

## Decision Audit Trail
**102 decisions logged** spanning infrastructure choices, security policies, operational procedures, and compliance measures. All decisions include operator, timestamp, scope, and evidence for full traceability.
